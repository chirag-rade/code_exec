The Assistant suggests using the `django-tenant-schemas` library, which is deprecated.\n\nIssues identified:\n1. Use of deprecated library (`django-tenant-schemas`) - Critical\n2. Incorrect database engine reference - Critical\n3. Misleading middleware configuration - Medium\n4. Lack of detailed instructions for switching libraries - Medium\n\nThe code provided is mostly correct but outdated due to the deprecated library. The critical issues severely impact the usefulness of the code. The middleware and database engine configurations are incorrect for the suggested library. Detailed migration steps should be provided if switching to `django-tenants`.",

    "scoring_explanation": "The code provided by the Assistant is mostly correct but relies on the deprecated `django-tenant-schemas` library, which is a critical issue. The outdated library reference, incorrect database engine, and misleading middleware configuration severely impact the code's correctness and usefulness. Additionally, the lack of detailed migration instructions for switching to `django-tenants` is a significant drawback. These issues collectively result in a low score.",
