        "1. **Text Preprocessing:**\n",
        "  - The function `preprocess_text()` converts all characters to lowercase and remove non-alphanumeric characters.\n",
        "  - Ensures consistency in string comparison by eliminating case sensitivity and non-alphanumeric characters.\n",
        "2. **Finding Longest Palindrome:** The function `manacher_longest_palindrome()` implements Manacher's Algorithm to discover the longest palindrome. Here  are the algorithm steps:\n",
        "  - Initializes variables and data structures.\n",
        "  - Iterates over each input string.\n",
        "  - Expands palindromes around each character, considering both odd and even-length cases.\n",
        "  - Updates information about the longest palindrome found during expansion.\n",
        "  - Efficiently identifies the longest palindromic substring in each input string.\n",

        "In summary, the adaptation of Manacher's Algorithm in Python showcases its robustness in efficiently discovering the longest palindrome within a given text, even when the input string contains special characters or a mix of upper and lower case letters. Whether analyzing textual data for linguistic patterns or extracting meaningful information from noisy sources, this algorithmic technique offers a powerful tool for various applications in natural language processing, data mining, and beyond. Manacher's algorithm achieves linear time complexity $O(n)$ by preprocessing the string and iterating over each character twice to find palindromes. Each character is visited twice in the worst case, leading to an overall time complexity of $O(n)$."
