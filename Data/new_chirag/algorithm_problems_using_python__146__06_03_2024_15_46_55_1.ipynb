        "1. **`Node` Class:**\n",
        "Represents a node in the linked list used for chaining in the hash map. It stores the key and value of the key-value pair and has a pointer to the next node.\n",

        "Implements a hash map with chaining to handle collisions. It tracks the number of key-value pairs stored and has an array to store linked list buckets for each hash index.\n",

        "Computes the hash value of a given key to determine the index in the buckets array. It returns the remainder of the key's hash value divided by the capacity.\n",

        "\n",
        "  - Inserts a key-value pair into the hash map, consisting of the key and its associated value.\n",
        "  - Compute the hash index using the `_hash` method.\n",

        "  - If the bucket is not empty, traverse the linked list until the end.\n",
        "  - If the key already exists, update its value; otherwise, append a new node to the end of the linked list.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **`get` Method:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Retrieves the value associated with a given key from the hash map, based on the provided key.\n",
        "  - The value associated with the given key, or `None` if the key is not found.\n",
        "  - Compute the hash index using the `_hash` method.\n",
        "  - Traverse the linked list at the computed index to find the node with the matching key.\n",
        "  - If the key is found, return its associated value; otherwise, return `None`.\n",
        "\n",
        "  In summary, we've explored a practical application of hash maps in Python by efficiently tallying the word frequencies within a sizable text document. By employing chaining to manage collisions, we've ensured a reliable method for tracking the occurrence of each word. This not only presents a valuable tool for data analysis but also underscores the importance of robust data structures in handling real-world challenges efficiently. The time complexity of insertion and retrieval in the provided hash map implementation is $O(1)$ on average, but $O(n)$ in the worst case due to potential collisions resulting in linear traversal of linked lists."

        "Got it! When dealing with chaining to handle collisions in hash maps, there are several potential drawbacks and limitations to consider, especially when working with large datasets:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Increased Memory Overhead:** Chaining requires additional memory to store linked lists or other data structures to handle collisions. This can lead to increased memory usage, especially if the hash map is storing a large number of elements or if the collision resolution mechanism results in many small chains.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Poor Performance with High Collision Rates:** If the hash function is not well-designed or if the dataset has clustering tendencies, causing many elements to hash to the same bucket, chaining may lead to long chains. Searching within long chains can degrade performance, as it involves traversing through potentially many elements to find the desired key-value pair.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Cache Inefficiency:** Long chains can lead to poor cache utilization, especially if the elements in the chain are not stored contiguously in memory. This can result in increased cache misses and slower access times, particularly on modern computer architectures where memory access patterns significantly impact performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Non-Uniform Distribution of Keys:** If the distribution of keys is highly skewed or not well-distributed, chaining may exacerbate the problem by concentrating many keys in the same buckets. This can lead to uneven chain lengths and further degrade performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Difficulty in Load Factor Management:** With chaining, managing the load factor (the ratio of the number of elements to the number of buckets) becomes crucial. If the load factor becomes too high, causing many collisions and longer chains, performance may suffer. However, dynamically resizing the hash map to maintain a low load factor can be costly in terms of time and memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Difficulty in Parallelization:** Chaining can be more challenging to parallelize compared to other collision resolution techniques like open addressing. Concurrent access to elements in the same chain may require synchronization mechanisms, which can introduce overhead and complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, chaining is a simple and effective technique for handling collisions in hash maps, its efficiency and scalability can be impacted by factors such as collision rate, memory usage, cache efficiency, and key distribution. As datasets grow larger and performance requirements become more demanding, alternative collision resolution strategies may need to be considered to mitigate these limitations."
