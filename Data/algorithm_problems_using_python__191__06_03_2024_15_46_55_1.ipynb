This leaves you by the end of the iteration with the k largest elements in the heap, where the first or smallest element in it is the kth largest integer overall in the list.

For the same strategy to work, you'd actually need a max-heap because if you make n pushes and n - k pops, in order for the remaining k to be the k smallest elements overall in the list, you need the pop operations to remove all the n - k largest elements, which is what would happen with a max-heap.
