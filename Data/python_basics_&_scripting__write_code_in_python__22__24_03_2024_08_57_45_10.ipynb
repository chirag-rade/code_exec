        "\n",
        "1. The `update_employee_name` function takes the filename, record number, and new name as arguments.\n",
        "2. It defines the `record_size` based on the assumed structure of the employee data (4 bytes for ID and 20 bytes for the name).\n",
        "3. It opens the file in read-write binary mode (`'rb+'`).\n",
        "4. The `byte_offset` is calculated by multiplying the record number with the record size.\n",
        "5. `file.seek()` moves the file pointer to the calculated byte offset.\n",
        "6. Optionally, the existing ID is read using `file.read(4)` and converted to an integer.\n",
        "7. The new name is encoded with the same fixed length as the original name and padded with spaces if necessary.\n",
        "8. `file.write()` writes the encoded new name data at the current file pointer position, updating the name in the record.\n",
        "9. The function prints a success message with the updated record information.\n",
        "10. Error handling is included for file not found and other exceptions.\n",
        "11. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with specific parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach allows you to efficiently update a specific record in the binary file without modifying the entire file contents. Remember to adjust the record_size based on your actual data structure and handle potential errors appropriately.\n",
