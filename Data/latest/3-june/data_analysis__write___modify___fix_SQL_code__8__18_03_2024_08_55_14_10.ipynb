        "**Suggested Conversation :** - Hey!! I am a data analyst at ZephyrTech an online electronics store. We're diving into our sales figures from the last quarter to unearth insights about our customer base to understand the spending patterns of new vs returning customers. Our 'SalesData' table, where transactions are logged, includes 'TransactionID', 'CustomerID', 'CustomerType', 'PurchaseAmount', and 'PurchaseDate'. So I want a sql query for my postgresql db that not only compares the average purchase amounts between these two groups but does so through conditional aggregation. Can you help me devise this query?\n",
