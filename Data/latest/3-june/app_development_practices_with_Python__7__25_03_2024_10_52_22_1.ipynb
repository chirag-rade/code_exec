        "  - **Closing Resources**: The cursor and connection are closed to free up database resources.\n",

        "2. **SQLAlchemy**:\n",
        "  - **Creating an Engine**: The `create_engine` function establishes a connection to your PostgreSQL database.\n",
        "  - **Defining Metadata and Table**: Metadata is used to reflect the database schema, and the `users` table is defined using the `Table` class.\n",
        "  - **Constructing the Query**: The `select` function constructs a SQL query with parameterized input using the `where` method to filter results based on the `user_id`.\n",

        "Here is the code explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Using psycopg2 with connection pooling:**\n",
        "\n",
        " The `psycopg2` library's `SimpleConnectionPool` is used to manage a pool of database connections. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:\n",
        "- **Initialization**: A connection pool is created with `SimpleConnectionPool(1, 20, ...)` where `1` is the minimum number of connections to keep in the pool and `20` is the maximum number of connections.\n",
        "- **Getting a Connection**: The `get_user_data` function retrieves a connection from the pool using `connection_pool.getconn()`.\n",
        "- **Executing a Query**: A cursor is created using the connection, and a parameterized query is executed to prevent SQL injection.\n",
        "- **Returning the Connection**: The connection is returned to the pool with `connection_pool.putconn(conn)` after the query execution is complete. This allows the connection to be reused by other parts of the application, improving performance by avoiding the overhead of establishing new connections repeatedly.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Using SQLAlchemy with connection pooling:**\n",
        "\n",
        " SQLAlchemy simplifies connection pooling with its `create_engine` function. Here's the detailed process:\n",
        "- **Engine Creation**: The `create_engine` function is used to create an engine that manages connections to the database. The `pool_size` parameter sets the number of connections to keep in the pool (10 in this example), and `max_overflow` determines how many additional connections can be created if the pool is exhausted (20 in this example).\n",
        "- **Metadata and Table Definition**: The `MetaData` and `Table` classes are used to define and interact with the `users` table.\n",
        "- **Executing a Query**: The `get_user_data` function creates a query using SQLAlchemy's `select` and `where` functions. The query is executed with `connection.execute(query)`.\n",
        "- **Connection Management**: SQLAlchemy handles the connection pooling automatically, reusing connections as needed to improve performance and efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "By using these connection pooling mechanisms, your application can handle a large number of database operations efficiently, reducing the overhead associated with opening and closing database connections frequently.\n",
