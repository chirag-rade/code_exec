    "- Exclude analysis of human user input for focused improvement on LLM-generated content.\n",
    "- Exclude LLM Assistant text content that is not related to the code, only review code snippets and code cells. Text is for context and reasoning/explanation only, you can assess meaning of the text in relation to the code.\n",

    "**2. Evaluation Criteria Definitions**\n",
    "- Correctness: The code must be devoid of bugs and errors.\n",
    "- Efficiency: The code must be optimized for maximum performance.\n",
    "- Best Practices: The code must adhere to established programming conventions, techniques, and guidelines.\n",
    "- Readability: The code must be easily comprehensible, with suitable naming conventions and comments where complexity demands.\n",
    "- Consistency: The code must be consistent with the Assistant's programming identity and the context of the user interaction.\n",
    "- Completeness of the conversation as a whole: was user request satisfied or does conversation still needs more interactions(very bad)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Review Guidelines**\n",
