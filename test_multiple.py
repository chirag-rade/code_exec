```python
import multiprocessing

def say_hello():
    print("Hello, World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create four processes
    processes = [multiprocessing.Process(target=say_hello) for _ in range(4)]

    for process in processes:
        process.start()

    # Wait for the processes to finish
    for process in processes:
        process.join()
```
This code creates four processes, each of which runs the say_hello function, which prints "Hello, World!" to the console. The if __name__ == "__main__": guard is used to ensure that the code inside it is only executed when the script is run directly, and not when it is imported as a module.

The multiprocessing.Process class is used to create a new process, and the target parameter specifies the function to be run in the new process. The start() method is used to start the process, and the join() method is used to wait for the process to finish before continuing.

When you run this code, you should see "Hello, World!" printed to the console four times, once for each process.""",

```python
import multiprocessing
import time
import random

def say_hello():
    message = "Hello, World!"
    color = random.choice(["\033[91m", "\033[93m", "\033[92m", "\033[94m", "\033[95m"])

    for process in processes:
        process.start()

    # Wait for the processes to finish
    for process in processes:
        process.join()
```
This code uses the random module to randomly choose a color for the "Hello, World!" message. It also uses the time module to add a delay between messages.

The \033[91m and similar codes are ANSI escape codes that change the color of the text in the console. The \033[0m code resets the color to the default.

When you run this code, you should see four "Hello, World!" messages printed to the console in random colors, with a one-second delay between each message.
