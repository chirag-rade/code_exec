Can you help me devise this query?\\\\n\\\\n**Assistant**\\\\n\\\\nCertainly! To differentiate between new and returning customers, we\\'ll consider a customer new if their transaction, in question, is their first ever transaction in your `SalesData` table; otherwise, we\\'ll consider them returning.\\\\n\\\\nHere\\'s a SQL query that should meet your requirements:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\n-- Calculate the average purchase amount for both new and returning customers\\\\nSELECT\\\\n  AVG(CASE\\\\n        WHEN CustomerFirstPurchaseDate.PurchaseDate = SalesData.PurchaseDate THEN SalesData.PurchaseAmount\\\\n      END) AS AveragePurchaseAmountNewCustomers,\\\\n  \\\\n  AVG(CASE\\\\n        WHEN CustomerFirstPurchaseDate.PurchaseDate <> SalesData.PurchaseDate THEN SalesData.PurchaseAmount\\\\n      END) AS AveragePurchaseAmountReturningCustomers\\\\nFROM\\\\n  SalesData\\\\nJOIN\\\\n  (SELECT CustomerID, MIN(PurchaseDate) AS PurchaseDate\\\\n   FROM SalesData\\\\n   GROUP BY CustomerID) AS CustomerFirstPurchaseDate\\\\nON\\\\n  SalesData.CustomerID = CustomerFirstPurchaseDate.CustomerID;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis query does the following:\\\\n\\\\n- Identifies each customer\\'s first purchase using a subquery.\\\\n\\\\n- Joins this data with  `SalesData`  to match each transaction to the first purchase date.\\\\n\\\\n- Calculates average purchase amounts using conditional aggregation:\\\\n  -  For new customers, it averages amounts on their first purchase date.\\\\n  -  For returning customers, it averages amounts on subsequent dates.\\\\n\\\\n**User**\\\\n\\\\nCould you show how to calculate the median purchase amount for new vs returning customers as well for a more nuanced understanding of spending patterns?\\\\n\\\\n**Assistant**\\\\n\\\\nThis can be achieved through creative use of window functions and conditional logic. Given your scenario, first, we separate new vs. returning customers, then calculate the median purchase amount for these two groups. Here\\\\u2019s a way to approach it:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nWITH RankedPurchases AS (\\\\n    \\\\n    SELECT\\\\n        SalesData.CustomerID,\\\\n        SalesData.PurchaseAmount,\\\\n        -- Determine if the transaction is from a new customer (first purchase)\\\\n        CustomerFirstPurchaseDate.PurchaseDate = SalesData.PurchaseDate AS IsNewCustomer,\\\\n        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(\\\\n            PARTITION BY SalesData.CustomerID, CustomerFirstPurchaseDate.PurchaseDate\\\\n            ORDER BY SalesData.PurchaseAmount\\\\n        ) AS RowAsc,\\\\n        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(\\\\n            PARTITION BY SalesData.CustomerID, CustomerFirstPurchaseDate.PurchaseDate\\\\n            ORDER BY SalesData.PurchaseAmount DESC\\\\n        ) AS RowDesc\\\\n    FROM\\\\n        SalesData\\\\n    JOIN\\\\n        -- Subquery to determine each customer\\'s first PurchaseDate\\\\n        (SELECT CustomerID, MIN(PurchaseDate) AS PurchaseDate\\\\n        FROM SalesData\\\\n        GROUP BY CustomerID) AS CustomerFirstPurchaseDate\\\\n        ON SalesData.CustomerID = CustomerFirstPurchaseDate.CustomerID\\\\n),\\\\nPurchaseCounts AS (\\\\n  \\\\n    SELECT\\\\n        IsNewCustomer,\\\\n        COUNT(*) AS Total\\\\n    FROM RankedPurchases\\\\n    GROUP BY IsNewCustomer\\\\n),\\\\nMedians AS (\\\\n   \\\\n    SELECT\\\\n        RP.IsNewCustomer,\\\\n        -- Median computed as the average PurchaseAmount around the center of the dataset\\\\n        AVG(RP.PurchaseAmount) AS MedianPurchaseAmount\\\\n    FROM RankedPurchases RP\\\\n    JOIN PurchaseCounts PC ON RP.IsNewCustomer = PC.IsNewCustomer\\\\n   \\\\n    WHERE RP.RowAsc BETWEEN PC.Total/2.0 AND PC.Total/2.0 + 1\\\\n       OR RP.RowDesc BETWEEN PC.Total/2.0 AND PC.Total/2.0 + 1\\\\n    GROUP BY RP.IsNewCustomer\\\\n)\\\\n\\\\nSELECT\\\\n    CASE\\\\n        WHEN IsNewCustomer = 1 THEN \\'New Customers\\'\\\\n        ELSE \\'Returning Customers\\'\\\\n    END AS CustomerType,\\\\n    MedianPurchaseAmount\\\\nFROM Medians;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThe query works as follows:\\\\n\\\\n- Assigns ascending and descending rank to each transaction based on purchase amount, identifying purchases as from new or returning customers.\\\\n\\\\n- Counts transactions for both customer groups.\\\\n\\\\n- Determines the median purchase amount by finding the middle-ranked transactions and averaging if necessary.\\\\n\\\\n- Labels each row as new or returning customer and displays their median purchase amounts.\"}')], 'sender': 'testers'}}\n"
