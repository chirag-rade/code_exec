The first query calculates the average purchase amount, and the second query calculates the median purchase amount using window functions and conditional logic. The code needs to be evaluated for correctness, efficiency, best practices, readability, and consistency. The conversation should also be assessed for completeness in addressing the user's request.",

    "scoring_explanation": "The conversation did not fully satisfy the user's request due to critical issues in the second SQL query. The syntax error for the column alias and the flawed logic for median calculation significantly impact the correctness and usefulness of the code. Additionally, the ambiguous column reference further detracts from the code's readability and correctness. While the first query is correct, the critical issues in the second query prevent the overall conversation from achieving a high score.",
