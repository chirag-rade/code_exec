    "scratchpad": "The conversation metadata indicates that the user is a data analyst seeking to compare average and median purchase amounts between new and returning customers using SQL queries for a PostgreSQL database. The conversation includes two primary SQL queries: one for calculating average purchase amounts and another for calculating median purchase amounts. The user specifically asked for conditional aggregation in the first query.\n\nThe first query correctly uses conditional aggregation to calculate average purchase amounts for new and returning customers. It joins the `SalesData` table with a subquery that identifies the first purchase date for each customer. The second query aims to calculate median purchase amounts using window functions and conditional logic. However, there are some issues with both queries.\n\nThe tests provided indicate that the average purchase amount query works correctly, but there are issues with the median purchase amount query. Specific issues include incorrect SQL syntax for determining new customers, inappropriate use of `ROW_NUMBER` for calculating the median, inconsistent alias usage, and missing references to metadata in the conversation.",

    "scoring_explanation": "The first SQL query for calculating average purchase amounts is mostly correct but could be slightly optimized for readability. The second SQL query for calculating median purchase amounts has critical issues, including incorrect SQL syntax for determining new customers and inappropriate use of `ROW_NUMBER` for calculating the median. These issues significantly affect the correctness and efficiency of the query. Additionally, inconsistent alias usage and missing references to metadata reduce readability and context understanding. Given these issues, the conversation requires further interaction to fully satisfy the user's request.",
