    "scratchpad": "The conversation consists of two main SQL queries. The first one is for calculating the average purchase amounts for new and returning customers using conditional aggregation. The second one is for calculating the median purchase amounts for the same groups using window functions. The user requested a SQL query for comparing average purchase amounts and later asked for the median as well.\n\nThe provided SQL queries seem logically sound but contain a critical syntax error in the second query, specifically in the assignment of the 'IsNewCustomer' flag. The user tests indicate the first query runs correctly and achieves the desired results, but there is no mention of a successful run for the second query.\n\nThe `IsNewCustomer` calculation should be addressed using a CASE statement. Additionally, it's crucial to ensure the queries handle edge cases like customers with a single purchase or when there are no new/returning customers.",
