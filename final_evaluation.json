There was a mention of a syntax error in the print statement, but this was not actually present in the provided code, so this issue is not valid.\n3. The tests run on the code provided a result for only one test case, which is not sufficient to confirm the robustness of the code.\n\nThe binary search function is otherwise well-written and follows best practices in terms of readability, comments, and structure.
