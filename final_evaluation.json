{"scratchpad": "The conversation revolves around implementing a multi-tenant architecture in Django using the `django-tenant-schemas` library. The code provided includes configurations in `settings.py`, model definitions in `models.py`, and example usage. However, several issues are present in the code that could impact its effectiveness, security, and maintainability. Critical issues include the use of a deprecated library and hardcoded database credentials. Medium severity issues include the lack of error handling in example usage code. Additionally, there are low severity issues related to the lack of explanations for certain configuration settings.", "issues": [{"cell_position": 6, "what": "Use of deprecated library `django-tenant-schemas`.", "why": "The `django-tenant-schemas` library is no longer maintained and has known issues that are not being addressed.
